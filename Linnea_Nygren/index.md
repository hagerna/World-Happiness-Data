# World Happiness Data Visualization (Linnea Nygren)

I'm initially looking at the countries with the lowest and highest subjective happiness/well-being scores (called ladder score in the dataset) and looking at correlations
between that ladder score and other variables. For now, I have just looked at the "freedom to make life choices" variable and compared it with the ladder score to find trends.
