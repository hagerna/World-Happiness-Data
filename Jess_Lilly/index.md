# World Happiness Data Visualization (Jess Lilly)

The Global World Happiness Ranking Gallup publishes yearly is based on a
single data indicator: life ladder scores determined through something
known as the Cantril Index. The Cantril Index is used to rank countries in
terms of happiness. Countries are ranked in based on survey responses to a
single question: "Please imagine a ladder, with steps numbered from 0 at
the bottom to 10 at the top. The top of the ladder represents the best
possible life for you and the bottom of the ladder represents the worst
possible life for you. On which step of the ladder would you say you
personally feel you stand at this time?" Countries are ranked by mean
life ladder score, with the highest score denoting the happiest country
globally, and the lowest score denoting the least happy country globally. I
am interested in investigating the validity of the Cantril Index in
determining the happiness of a country.
Hello world.
