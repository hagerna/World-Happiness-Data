# World Happiness Data Visualization: (Martin Alvarez-Kuglen)

I am interested in understanding the internal relationships between the data collected in these reports. When doing research for this project, I came across this dataset and found myself asking so many questions. What were the categories of data collected? How did these categories get chosen? What can they reveal about our society? Are there ways the data may be biased towards particular cultures?

We all have assumptions about what the data will show. I think most people assume high GDP will be linked to high happiness. But is this true? If so, why is it true? Are there more internal relationships we can pull out of the data to gain a better understanding?

For my first visualization I have created a scatter plot of Life Ladder and Social Support (I call them 'General Life Enjoyment' and 'Social Support Evaluation' as those seem like more apt descriptions).

Initially I found this graph very interesting. It seems to reveal something that I think is not surprising -- that is, the higher the General Life Enjoyment the higher the Social Support Evaluation. Now, the immediate answer most would come to is 'well, social support must increase happiness!' While I find this a compelling explanation, I am curious if we can dig deeper. Could there be an underlying factor that may be illuminated by further analysis of the data?

During this project I hope to answer this question and many more. I would like to begin to test the skills we have learned to see how many nuances I can tease out of this data. I would love to learn more about the statistical analysis side of this kind of data analysis as well! So continue reading with me as we investigate the internal relationships of the World Happiness Report.
