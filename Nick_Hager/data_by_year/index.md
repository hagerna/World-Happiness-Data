# World Happiness Data 

Here you can see all the visualizations that focus on a particular year from the World Health Report (2021) data and allow you view a particular factor attributed to happiness by selecting it from the dropdown menu on the left. While not displayed immediately, once you make a selection you will also see an annotation with the countries that scored the highest and lowest for that particular factor.
