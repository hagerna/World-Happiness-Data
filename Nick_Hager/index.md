# World Happiness Data Visualization (Nick Hager)

My initial interest in the dataset is determining how much of the data is usable, for example, after an initial glance I could determine that some countries have entries dating back to 2005 but others do not. In order to accurately compare the data from different countries year to year, it is important to ensure that both countries actually have data to compare and that they have an equal baseline.

The data appears to reach a roughly consistent number of countries in 2011 which makes sense as on the World Happiness Report website, the first report was released for 2012, examining the previous year. For this reason, when comparing all the countries together, 2011 will serve as a good baseline year for which all the countries involved have data. It is also worth noting that there is a noticeable drop in the number of countries with data for the year 2020. The authors of the World Happiness Report (2021) attribute the difficulties with collecting data to the COVID-19 global pandemic and as a result of this, for our purposes when making certain comparisons we may choose to exclude the year of 2020 or choose to examine it more by itself.
